I am a third-year PhD student at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. Wenjing Lou. I am also part of the [CNSR-VT](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/) lab. My research interests include blockchain and network security.


I graduated with my B.S. in Information Security from Nankai University in Tianjin, China, in June 2020. Later, I graduated with an M.S. in IT Cyber Security from the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom, in January 2022.
